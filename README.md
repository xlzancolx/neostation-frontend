## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Windows | ✅ Supported | x64 |
| Linux | ✅ Supported | x64, ARM64 (AppImage, Flatpak) |
| macOS | ✅ Supported | Apple Silicon & Intel |
| Android | ✅ Supported | ARM64, Android TV compatible |

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK ≥ 3.9.2
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)
- Git
- RetroArch or standalone emulators

## Installation

### Linux (Flatpak)

```bash
# Coming soon to Flathub! In the meantime, you can build locally:
flatpak-builder --user --install-deps-from=flathub \
  --repo=repo --force-clean \
  build-dir linux/flatpak/com.neogamelab.neostation.yml
```

### Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/miguelsotobaez/neostation-frontend.git
cd neostation-frontend

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get
```

## Build-time Configuration

NeoStation uses compile-time environment variables (`--dart-define`) for Flutter configuration, and Gradle properties for Android signing. No `.env` files are required at runtime.

### Flutter variables (via `--dart-define` or `.env`)

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` for local development.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RA_API_KEY` | RetroAchievements API key — get yours at [retroachievements.org/controlpanel.php](https://retroachievements.org/controlpanel.php) |
| `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID` | ScreenScraper developer ID |
| `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD` | ScreenScraper developer password |

### Android release signing (optional)

If you want your release APKs signed with a release certificate (required for app store distribution and seamless user upgrades), create `android/key.properties` from `android/key.properties.example`.

```properties
storePassword=your_password
keyPassword=your_password
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=../release.jks
```

If `android/key.properties` is not present, the build automatically falls back to debug signing, which is sufficient for local testing and sideloading.

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`) reads build secrets from your repository. You can store them as **Environment secrets**.

**Required for all platforms:**

| Secret / Variable | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `RA_API_KEY` | RetroAchievements API key |
| `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID` | ScreenScraper developer ID |
| `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD` | ScreenScraper developer password |

**Required for Android release signing:**

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Your `release.jks` file encoded as **base64** (binary, not text). See below. |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias (e.g. `upload`) |

> **Important:** `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` must be the **binary keystore file** (`.jks`), not the `key.properties` text file. To encode it:
> ```bash
> # Linux / macOS
> base64 -w 0 release.jks
>
> # Windows PowerShell
> [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("release.jks"))
> ```

If the Android secrets are missing, the CI build falls back to debug signing (users will need to uninstall before installing a new release).

### Running

```bash
# Development
flutter run \
  --dart-define=RA_API_KEY=your_key \
  --dart-define=SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID=your_id \
  --dart-define=SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD=your_password

# Production builds
# Replace these with your actual keys
DART_DEFINES="--dart-define=RA_API_KEY=your_key --dart-define=SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID=your_id --dart-define=SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD=your_password"

# Android APK
flutter build apk --release $DART_DEFINES

# Windows
flutter build windows --release $DART_DEFINES

# Linux
flutter build linux --release $DART_DEFINES

# macOS
flutter build macos --release $DART_DEFINES
```
